DOM and BOM Web Applications

This project I created a Web Application using DOM and BOM for a Basketball Team allowing each player 
stats to be edited with a click of a couple buttons using DOM. Also, I created a button that allows you
to go to another window which is the the comment page and another button next to  that button that allows 
you to close the window when done commenting, Using BOM. On the comment page theres an input and a button
that allows you to add on the the comments where you could enter what ever comment you want about 
the team *hopefully good* because the button changes to "Thanks For The Support", after you enter your comment, 
this was created using DOM also.
